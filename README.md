# Tech card

A simple HTML/CSS card component.

This project is part of the responsive design course from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). [Design specs](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/3bcaad42-bd8a-415e-6274-08b282cfb769-4dfb/) and starter files are provided by [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell/reponsive-web-design-bootcamp).

## Implementation

* Responsive cards.
* Mobile first design.
* Two implementations: one that uses only Flex and another that combines both Flex and Grid.

While my implementation follows the course content loosely, it also incorporates improvements that address most of the underlying issues.

## Dependencies

External:

* [:focus-visible](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) polyfill.

## Run locally
